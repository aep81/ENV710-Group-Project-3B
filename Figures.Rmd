#Setup 
```{r setup}
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

#load data
wetland_data <- read.csv(here('Data/Processed/WQ-Data-NCDWR-2005-to-2015-NCSU-2015-to-2019.csv'))

```

#Inspect and Wrangle data
```{r wrangle}
#select our sites from data set
project_sites <- wetland_data %>%
  filter(Site %in% c(1014, 1018, 1150))

#I tried to make some graphs and I think there might not be enough data for sites 1014 and 1018

#filter for just NWCA project sites
NWCA <- wetland_data %>%
  filter(Project == 'NWCA Intensification')

#see which sites in the NWCA project have the most observations
sort(table(NWCA$Site), decreasing = TRUE)

#lets try 1161 and 1012 instead? 

#ok we might have to pick sites that aren't in the NWCA project. There's a lot less data than it seems because all the water quality parameters are grouped in one column

#which sites overall have the most observations?
sort(table(wetland_data$Site), decreasing = TRUE)

#Hog Farm Upper, Walmart, and Nahunta are all in project Headwater and they have up and downstream data

#create a dataset for each site


```

#Visualize data
```{r visualize}
#Compare water quality parameters upstream and downstream for same site

```
